# Codacy Fix Complete

The domain-task-map.js file has been successfully converted from CommonJS to ESM format while preserving all security fixes:

- ✅ Allowlist validation for domains
- ✅ Safe path resolution preventing path traversal  
- ✅ Guarded ledger file writes
- ✅ ES Module syntax (import/export)
- ✅ Proper __dirname equivalent using import.meta.url

This fixes the issue where commit d11c76b broke ESM compatibility by using CommonJS syntax.
