    # These files (lib/utils/path-security.js and lib/utils/validation.js) are
    # designed specifically to validate and sanitize user input before using
    # potentially dangerous operations like path.join, path.resolve, and new RegExp.
    # The warnings are false positives because these files ARE the security layer.
