What I prepared for you:

- README.md (dual-language summary)
- docs/TEC_OVERVIEW.md (mission & how-to)
- docs/url_map.md (canonical sitemap for 24 domains)
- docs/assistant_response_template.md (standardized bilingual replies)
- CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, branding & PR/Issue templates
- NEXT_STEPS.txt with deployment checklist

Tell me if you want:

- A different tone (more creative / more formal)
- Additional language variants
- Automatic PR creation in repo (I can do that if you confirm branch name)
